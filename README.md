Blackjack Game
===============

Blackjack game was made for browser-based Python interpreter CodeSkulptor for the online course “An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python” from RICE University. 

**Rules**
=======

Cards in Blackjack have the following values:

  * an ace may be valued as either 1 or 11 (player's choice),
  * face cards (kings, queens and jacks) are valued at 10,
  * the value of the remaining cards corresponds to their number.

During a round of game, the players plays against a dealer with the goal of building a  hand (a collection of cards) whose cards have a total value that is higher than the
value of the dealer's hand, but not over 21.
